Current Status: Phase 1 (Core Logic) — Functional Programming.

This project is a milestone in my Python roadmap. It handles expense logging with JSON persistence.

Key Features:

- Track expenses with amount, category, and date.

- JSON data storage for persistence between sessions.

- Summary reporting (calculate totals by category).
